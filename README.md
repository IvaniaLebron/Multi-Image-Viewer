# Multi-Image-Viewer
A multi-image viewer is a software application or tool that allows you to view and navigate through multiple images or photographs within a single interface. It is designed to make it easier to browse, organize, and sometimes edit or perform other operations on a collection of images without the need to open each image individually.
